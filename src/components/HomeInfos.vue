            Soyumi Asian Kitchen opened in August 2017 in Statesboro, GA. Fueled
            by the food journeys of the proprietors, Soyumi was developed as a
            concept to broaden the horizons of it’s patrons as well as it’s team
            members. Coined from the phrase that’s exclaimed when something
            tasty hits the spot: “its so yummy!”, we strive to provide an
            experience that is unlike any other.
